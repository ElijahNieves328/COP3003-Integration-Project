# JRPG FTW
This is a top-down Diablo-like dungeon-crawler with a planned selectable class system, customizable level-up system, and randomized levels and item drops. It will have a discoverable map and real-time HUD with an active inventory management system and an optional story. Hopefully, it will have support for multiplayer in the future. We are making a game for our Programming II (Object Oriented Programming) integration project. This project is a collaboration between Michael DAgostino, Elijah Nieves, and Robert McNiven. We are using Unity game engine and mainly collaborated over Discord and in school.

# JRPG FTW Unity Game
We are making a game for our Programming II integration project. This project is a collaboration between Michael DAgostino, Elijah Nieves, and Robert McNiven.

## Demonstration

## Documentation
For this game we wrote all of our scripts in C#. We are using standard formatting with XML tags and [this coding style](https://github.com/dotnet/runtime/blob/main/docs/coding-guidelines/coding-style.md) from another GitHub repository.


## Diagrams
This is our initial class diagram for the Entity parent class and its children:

## Getting Started
Although our game is not complete, we plan to release it on Steam so others can play and enjoy it just as we have making it.


## Built With

 - Visual Studio
 - Unity Game Engine

## Contributing
If you would like to contribute and think you have good ideas, just message us on GitHub. We are also looking for new artwork eventually, so, if you are artistically inclined, please message us.

## Acknowledgments

 - I would like to thank the YouTube channel [Brackeys](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCYbK_tjZ2OrIZFBvU6CCMiA) (This is where we watched most of our Unity tutorials).
 - I would also like to thank everyone who gave input on our game, all together. Thank you for your advice and support!

## History
At first it was going to be a JRPG style game but it has turned more into a skill based dungeon crawler where you want to complete levels, kill enemies and survive!



## Key Programming Concepts Utilized
-   LO1. Design and implement a class.
    
    -   LO4. Include a comment in which you compare and contrast the procedural/functional approach and the object-oriented approach
        
    -   LO1a. At least one class in a header file with non-trivial methods implemented in a cpp file
        
    -   LO1b. Overload a constructor
        
    -   LO1c. Utilize an initialization list
        
-   LO2. Use subclassing to design simple class hierarchies that allow code to be reused for distinct subclasses.
    
    -   LO2a. Include comments describing the visibility inheritance model
        
-   LO3. Correctly reason about control flow in a program using dynamic dispatch.
    
-   LO5. Explain the relationship between object-oriented inheritance (code-sharing and overriding) and subtyping (the idea of a subtype being usable in a context that expects the supertype).
    
-   LO6. Use object-oriented encapsulation mechanisms such as interfaces and private members.
    
-   LO7. Define and use iterators and other operations on aggregates, including operations that take functions as arguments.
    
-   Follow best practices for style and readability
    
-   Follow best practices for documentation
