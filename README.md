</h2>
This is a top-down Diablo-like dungeon-crawler with a planned selectable class system, customizable level-up system, and randomized levels and item drops. It will have a discoverable map and real-time HUD with an active inventory management system and an optional story. Hopefully, it will have support for multiplayer in the future.
